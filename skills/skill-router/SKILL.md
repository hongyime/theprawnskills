  Route user requests to on-demand skills in the OneDrive canonical skill
  library. Use when a task sounds like it may need a non-installed skill, when
  the user asks which skill to use, or when work involves media, documents,
  presentations, writing, cloud platforms, agent setup, skill creation, or
  unfamiliar specialized tooling.

# Skill Router

Use this skill to find and load on-demand skills without installing the
whole library into every agent session.

## Source of Truth

Canonical skill library:

```text
C:\Users\bryan\OneDrive\01 SKILLS\.agents\skills
```

Skill file convention:

```text
C:\Users\bryan\OneDrive\01 SKILLS\.agents\skills\<kebab-name>\SKILL.md
```

Installed agent roots are only exposure targets. The canonical OneDrive
`skills/` folder is the durable library.

## Routing Workflow

When the user's request may match an on-demand skill:

1. Search canonical skill names and frontmatter descriptions.
2. Pick the smallest set of relevant skills.
3. Open and read each selected `SKILL.md` fully before using it.
4. If the selected skill links to task-specific references, read only the
   relevant referenced files.
5. If no skill clearly fits, continue normally and mention that no exact skill
   matched.

Use PowerShell-compatible search from this machine:

```powershell
$root = "C:\Users\bryan\OneDrive\01 SKILLS\.agents\skills"
Get-ChildItem -LiteralPath $root -Directory |
  ForEach-Object {
    $skill = Join-Path $_.FullName "SKILL.md"
    if (Test-Path -LiteralPath $skill) {
      Select-String -LiteralPath $skill -Pattern "description:|name:|# " -Context 0,2
    }
  }
```

Prefer `rg` for targeted text search:

```powershell
rg -n "deck|presentation|pptx|slides|pdf|image|video|azure|supabase|vercel" "C:\Users\bryan\OneDrive\01 SKILLS\.agents\skills" -g "SKILL.md"
```

Do not read secret files while routing. Skill folders should normally contain
instructions, references, scripts, assets, templates, and examples, not secrets.

## Common Routes

Use these as starting points, then verify by reading the actual `SKILL.md`.

| Marketing and launch content | `seo-content-brief`, `product-hunt-launch`, `linkedin-content`, `content-repurposing` |
| Image generation or editing | `ai-image-generation`, `gpt-image`, `flux-image`, `background-removal`, `image-upscaling`, `product-photography` |
| Video, audio, voice, podcasts | `image-to-video`, `ai-avatar-video`, `text-to-speech`, `speech-to-text`, `ai-podcast-creation` |
| Social content | `ai-social-media-content`, `social-media-carousel`, `twitter-thread-creation`, `youtube-thumbnail-design` |
| Agent tooling and delegation | `cli-agent-router`, `claude-code-cli`, `opencode-cli`, `codex`, `agent-browser` |

## Maintenance Rules

When adding, deleting, renaming, pruning, or auditing skills, also use
`skill-authoring`.

After skill library changes:

1. Ensure each new skill lives at `skills/<kebab-name>/SKILL.md`.
2. Update `default-profile.toml` if default-installed membership changed.
3. Update `INDEX.md` so installed/on-demand status stays accurate.
4. Update this router only when a new skill changes the common routing table or
   a renamed/deleted skill appears in the table.
5. Install this router into the default agent roots so future agents can find
   on-demand skills.

Do not run:

```powershell
dotagents sync
```

Use `dotagents install` only when `agents.toml` is known to be safe and the user
explicitly wants the manifest-installed defaults refreshed.

## Default Install Strategy

Keep default-installed skills lean:

- Always install this `skill-router`.
- Always install `skill-create`, `skill-add`, `skill-update`, `skill-cleanup`,
  and `skill-remove`.
- Always install `visual-explainer` and `postplan-upload`: use consistent
  dark/cyan HTML whenever a visual helps, even for short explanations. Use
  visual overview -> details -> next steps; publish when hosting is authorized.
- Keep essential coding, review, debugging, Cloudflare, and local setup skills
  installed when the user wants automatic discovery.
- Leave media, writing, document, presentation, Azure, Supabase, and Vercel
  skills on demand unless the user asks to make one default again.

Use `default-profile.toml` as the source of truth for default profile
membership. When a new CLI agent is installed, add its skill root to
`machines.toml` and apply the default profile.

Do not delete on-demand skills just because they are not installed.
