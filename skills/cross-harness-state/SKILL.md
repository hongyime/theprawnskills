  Maintain MOLT-style persistent agent state in a repo's .agents/ folder so any
  harness (Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, OpenCode) can resume work with zero
  ambiguity. Use when starting or ending significant work in a repo, when the
  user says update the state, save progress, journal this, resume from state,
  what were we doing, or when switching agents/machines mid-task and continuity
  must survive.

# Cross-Harness State (MOLT)

Keep durable, harness-agnostic work state inside each repo's `.agents/` folder so
the NEXT session — any agent, any machine that syncs the repo — resumes from
files, not from a chat transcript.

## Layout

```text
.agents/
  STATE.md          # NOW: current task + latest progress bullets
  JOURNAL.md        # HISTORY: dated one-line decisions/changes
  handoffs/         # SESSION DOCS: timestamped deep-recovery documents
  diagnosis/        # from bug-diagnosis skill (optional)
```

Create `.agents/` in the repo root if absent. These files are committed with the
repo unless it is a private scratch repo; they must never contain secrets.

## File Contracts

### STATE.md — always reflects NOW

```markdown
# Agent State

Current task: <one sentence describing the active goal>

Progress:
- Completed <ID/slug> locally: <what changed>. Verification passed: <exact checks>.
  <Explicitly what was NOT executed/persisted if relevant.>
- ...
```

Rules:

- Top of file = current truth. Old completed bullets get compacted: keep last
  ~10 detailed, compress older ones into one-liners, never delete silently.
- Every bullet ends with verification evidence (tests run, commands checked)
  and explicit negative claims where safety matters ("no deploy, no secret
  persistence").
- Written AFTER verification, not before.

### JOURNAL.md — append-only history

```markdown
# Agent Journal

- YYYY-MM-DD: <decision or change, one line, past tense>
- ...
```

One line per meaningful decision/change, newest at top. Include WHY for non-obvious
calls. Never edit old entries; corrections get new entries.

### handoffs/ — deep recovery docs

Timestamped `YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS-<slug>.md` documents created via the
`session-handoff` skill when a task pauses mid-flight or context is nearly full.
STATE.md gets ONE bullet pointing to it ("paused X, see .agents/handoffs/...").

Thin pointer files: any doc elsewhere (plans, specs, maps under `.agents/`) may be
referenced from STATE.md by path instead of being copied in. STATE stays lean;
pointers stay valid.

## Workflow

### Session start (resume)

1. Read `.agents/STATE.md` first, then referenced pointers/handoffs as needed.
2. Skim the top of JOURNAL.md for recent decisions (newest entries are first).
3. Confirm repo reality matches state (branch, key files exist). If drifted,
   update STATE.md noting drift BEFORE working.

### During work

- Journal entries at each real decision point.
- Update wizard/ticket/map artifacts in place; STATE points to them.

### Session end / milestone (save)

1. Add/update the STATE.md "Current task" + progress bullet with verification.
2. Append journal lines.
3. If pausing mid-task: create a handoff doc (`session-handoff`) and link it.
4. Commit `.agents/` changes together with related code when possible.

## No-Secrets Rules (hard)

- Never write tokens, keys, passwords, connection strings, client IPs of
  sensitive infra, or personal data into STATE/JOURNAL/handoffs.
- Reference secrets by NAME only ("uses GITHUB_TOKEN env var").
- Before committing, scan: `rg -n "(?i)(api[_-]?key|token|secret|password)\s*[:=]" .agents`
  and review hits.

## Harness Notes

- Works identically from Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, OpenCode — plain files, no
  tooling required.
- On OneDrive-synced repos, files sync across machines automatically; watch for
  sync conflicts after simultaneous edits on two machines — resolve by newest
  verified content, then re-append a journal line about the conflict.

## Related Skills

- `session-handoff` - creates the deep recovery docs stored in `.agents/handoffs/`
- `to-tickets`, `wayfinder` - artifacts STATE.md points to
- `bug-diagnosis` - diagnosis docs under `.agents/diagnosis/`

## Related workflow

For durable architectural rationale, use `architecture-decision-records` and link the record from STATE/JOURNAL instead of duplicating it. For bounded repeated repair, use `bounded-agent-loop`; hand off attempts consumed, remaining time and actual test evidence.
